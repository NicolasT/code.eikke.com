This patch will add DBUS [1] support to xscreensaver [2].

It is not tested, and won't be unless I can get my session message bus working [3].

You need to run "autoconf" in your xscreensaver directory after applying the patch.

DBUS support is enabled by adding "--enable-dbus" to ./configure.

See [4] for more information regarding this patch.
